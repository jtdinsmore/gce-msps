# Data description

The data was extracted from figure seven from [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0042v1.pdf) paper (Calore et al.) Stored in data.csv are the values of the exponents on the x and y axes, which had labels of E (GeV) and E^2 dN / dE (GeV cm^{-2} s^{-1} sr^{-1}) respectively. They use the same region of interest as us: 2 < |b| < 20 and |l| < 20.
